🎧 Hey, I’m @syhabira

🎸 Soundtracking my life with movies & music that hit different

💻 Currently studying at SMK Informatika Pesat Bogor

📩 Hit my DMs, I promise I have good playlists

❤️‍🩹 She/Her | Too curious for my own good, powered by overthinking & sarcasm

🎵Currently looping LDR, Radiohead, TV Girl, Frank Ocean, Tyler, Kanye, Daniel Caesar, The Weeknd, Sade, Oasis, and A7X

🎬 Mentally stuck in a Call Me by Your Name summer, romanticizing life like Little Women, but secretly living in a John Wick action sequence. Half my brain is in Interstellar, the other half trapped in The Matrix. Marvel raised me, and Christopher Nolan rewired my reality.

🍿 Fun fact: Timothée Chalamet is basically a genre of his own
